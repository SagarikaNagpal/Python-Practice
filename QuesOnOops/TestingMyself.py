# factorial
num = int(input("num: "))

factorial= 1

for i in range(1,num+1):

    factorial=factorial*i
    print("factorial of a num is", factorial)  #this will make all num in range
                                               #and typing out from for loop will give the direct ans like :
# print("factorial of a num is", factorial)
#uncomment the above line forthe direct ans
